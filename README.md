# OC_Projet_2
# International Expansion Project of the Company
## An EdTech startup named Academy offers online training content for high school and university-level audiences.
# A preliminary exploratory analysis mission to determine if the World Bank's education data can inform the international expansion project.

Here are the questions:
Which countries have a high potential for clients for our services?
For each of these countries, what is the evolution of this client potential?
In which countries should the company operate as a priority?

# The Data
The World Bank data is available at the following address:
https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/education-statistics.

In summary, the World Bank's "EdStats All Indicator Query" lists 4000 international indicators describing access to education, degree attainment, and information related to teachers, educational expenses, etc.

# For the Pre-Analysis:
Validate the quality of this dataset (does it have a lot of missing or duplicated data?)
Describe the information contained in the dataset (number of columns? number of rows?)
Select information that seems relevant to answer the problem (which columns contain information that can be useful to answer the company's problem?)
Determine the orders of magnitude of classic statistical indicators for different geographic areas and countries of the world (average/median/standard deviation per country and per continent or geographic block)
The work will determine if this dataset can inform decisions to open up to new countries. We will share the analysis with the board, so please take care of the presentation and illustrate it with relevant and readable graphs!
